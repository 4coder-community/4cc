*Purpose:
*       defines _filbuf() - fill buffer and read first character, allocate
*       buffer if there is none.  Used from getc().
*       defines _filwbuf() - fill buffer and read first wide character, allocate
*       buffer if there is none.  Used from getwc().

*Purpose:
*       get a buffer if the file doesn't have one, read into it, return first
*       char. try to get a buffer, if a user buffer is not assigned. called
*       only from getc; intended for use only within library. assume no input
*       stream is to remain unbuffered when memory is available unless it is
*       marked _IONBF. at worst, give it a single char buffer. the need for a
*       buffer, no matter how small, becomes evident when we consider the
*       ungetc's necessary in scanf
*
*       [NOTE: Multi-thread - _filbuf() assumes that the caller has aquired
*       the stream lock, if needed.]
*
*Entry:
*       FILE *stream - stream to read from
*
*Exit:
*       returns first character from buffer (next character to be read)
*       returns EOF if the FILE is actually a string, or not open for reading,
*       or if open for writing or if no more chars to read.
