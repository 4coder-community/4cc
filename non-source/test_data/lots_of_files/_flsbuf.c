*       defines _flswbuf() - flush a file buffer and output a wide character.
*       If no buffer, make one.

*Entry:

*       int ch - character to output.
*
*Exit:
*       returns -1 if FILE is actually a string, or if can't write ch to
*       unbuffered file, or if we flush a buffer but the number of chars
*       written doesn't agree with buffer size.  Otherwise returns ch.
